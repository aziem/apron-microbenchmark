#+TITLE: Apron microbenchmarking tool
#+AUTHOR: Aziem Chawdhary

Simple OCaml program to microbenchmark functions from the Apron domain. 
At the moment we focus on the meet operation. 

Generates a SAT octagon, then generates a number of linear constraints
to apply with meet. At the moment the the generated octagons are SAT
at the end.
